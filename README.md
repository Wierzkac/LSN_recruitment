## Getting Started

Welcome to my implementation of the LSN recruitment task.

## Usage

App will operate in a loop expecting either a number of task to run or a "q" sign to end the program.
Input the numbers in console.

## First task

Task expects a list of integers in one line.
It makes use of TreeSet to take care of sorting and holding only distinct values.

## Second task

Task expects a list of integers in one line.
It makes use of PriorityQueue to take care of sorting and allows duplicates.

## Third task

Task expects a integer representing the amount of lines user will input. After that it expects a set amount of pairs of numbers with space between them.
